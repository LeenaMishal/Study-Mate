### Student Task Management System – Software Engineering Project

StudyMate is a software engineering project focused on designing a structured student task management system. The project aims to help students organize their academic responsibilities, track deadlines, monitor progress, and improve overall productivity through a centralized platform.

Rather than focusing on implementation, this project emphasizes professional software engineering practices including requirements analysis, system architecture, process modeling, and UML design.


## 🚀 Project Overview
The system is designed to provide students with an organized digital environment where they can manage assignments, schedule deadlines, receive reminders, and evaluate their academic progress.

By applying structured engineering methodologies, the project demonstrates how a real-world academic productivity system can be planned, analyzed, and designed for scalability and usability.



## 🏗️ System Design
The proposed system follows a layered architecture to ensure clarity, maintainability, and future scalability:

- User Interface Layer: Defines how users interact with the system  
- Business Logic Layer: Handles system operations and workflow  
- Data Layer: Manages data storage and synchronization  
- External Services: Supports notifications, calendar integration, and reporting  



## 📊 Key Engineering Practices
This project applies core software engineering concepts, including:

- Requirements Engineering  
- Functional & Non-Functional Analysis  
- Incremental Process Model  
- System Architecture Design  
- UML Modeling  
- Human Interface Design  



## 🛠️ Tools & Modeling Techniques
- UML Diagrams (Use Case, Class, Sequence, Activity, State)  
- Lucidchart for system modeling  
- Structured Software Documentation  



## 🎯 Project Objective
The objective of StudyMate is to design a reliable and scalable system that enhances students’ time management and academic organization while reflecting real-world software engineering standards.



## 👩‍💻 Team Contribution
Developed collaboratively as part of a Software Engineering course, this project reflects strong teamwork, structured planning, and the application of industry-aligned engineering methodologies.
